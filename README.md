Stats 4001 Final Project: Understanding How to Build a Playoff Baseball Team

This project seeks to explore the underlying team statistics that best can predict a team’s likelihood
of reaching the MLB playoffs. The approach is two-fold, providing an “offensive” regression that
regresses wins on offensive statistics and a “defensive” regression that regresses wins on defensive
statistics. Data was collected from the 2008 season until the most recent 2023 season; however, 2020 was
omitted from the data set due to the coronavirus pandemic leading to a shortened season and unique
playoff format. These regressions helped show the significance of specific statistics influencing wins and
the magnitude and direction of these statistics. As we are interested in creating a model that creates a
playoff-caliber team, we then run a Monte-Carlo simulation for an imagined team with specific stats and
show the percentage of that team making the playoffs by reaching a threshold amount of wins.
